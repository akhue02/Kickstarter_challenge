# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
By using excel, we will analyze the data of the campaign through highly versatile such as an advanced formulas, filters and conditional formatting. At the end of the analysis, we can get a pivot table and a line chart by using the functions and filters. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine trends within the kickstarter campaign industry, specifically for theaters and plays. An up and coming playwright wants to start a crowd funding campaign to help fund her play. She's estimating a budget of over $10,000 but wants to first see if that is an accurate estimate before jumping in to her first crowdfunding campaing. We can use excel to organize, sort, and analyze data to help her get a better sense of the accuracy of her project's estimate. We will analyze to see if there are specific factors that make a campaign successful. Using excel to analyze this data will help our client gather a better understanding of campaigns from start to finish to better plan her own campaign

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Due to the client's interest in the theater data, the data was filtered by that category. The number of live outcomes were nominal and were filtered from the data set.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Due to the nominal number of live outcomes, the data was again filtered from the data set. The client's main interest is in the plays subcategory, so an additional filter was applied. The goals were then binned into groups of $5000. The total number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes were calculated for each bin and then converted into percentages.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In the future, it may be difficult to find the deciding factors causing the higher success rates for the higher funding goals of $35,000-$44,999


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
With May having the highest success rate and June coming in a close second, both Months are a great option for launching a theatrical production campaign.

Also, even though it is on the decline, July might be a good option as well due to there only being a 2.3% difference in success rate between July and June. Based on the numbers, I also advise steering clear of the Holiday seasons. When looking at the line chart you can clearly see a very low success rate around these times.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Although the Kickstarter dataset provided unique trends and valuable insights, there were some limitations that restricted deeper analyses. Perhaps one limitation could be lack of recent data, since the most recent campaign was in 2017. Recent data can help better uncover certain trends in types of successful Kickstarter data currently. In addition, more data in the parent category theatre and subcategory plays would portray a stronger outcome prediction, and maybe even distinctions in the plays category such as comedies, tragedies would highlight specific traction towards types of plays that tend to garner more attention/donations. Furthermore, more raw data from different sites such as IndieGoGo would also help make stronger analyses because with data, the more the merrier. Another factor could be a specific dataset ascertaining the amount of social outreach a campaign does, such as number of ads, tweets, which might imply higher success rates for those campaigns that reached out more.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One graph that would be useful to include for the analysis would be a box-and-whisker plot that compares the outliers by campaign category or months to see if outliers are influenced by other factors within the dataset. A graph that compares the country to the category would also be helpful in determining what types of campaigns are more successful in certain countries for future reference.
